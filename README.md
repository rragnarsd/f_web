## Obstacles
- The hardest part for me building this portfolio was the scaling or to get the site to be responsive :cold_sweat: 
- At one point I thought about going the easy way and switch to HTML/CSS/JS but now I'm really happy that I didn't because I learned alot on this adventure :nerd_face:
- So hopefully the next time I decide to build a Web App it will not be as frustrating :technologist:
